# S.. A.:

Personal website designed using [Particle.js](https://github.com/VincentGarreau/particles.js/) and the [Particle](https://github.com/nrandecker/particle) Jekyll theme. 

Initial site is just a portfolio page and project assets, but will in the future be expanded with posts and detailed content.
